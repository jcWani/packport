## About The Project

<p align="center">
PackPort is a modern e-commerce website that showcases different kinds of bags. This project was built as part of my learning journey, following "The Ultimate Fullstack Next.JS 14 Course 2024 Edition" by DevelopedByEd. It helped me gain hands-on experience with Next.js 14, authentication, payments, and more while customizing and expanding upon the base project.
